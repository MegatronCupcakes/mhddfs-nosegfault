# mhddfs-nosegfault

Mhddfs meets the real environment

* No more segmentation faults which were introduced in 0.1.39. This was a main cause of 'Transport endpoint is not connected'
* Configure ulimits on startup to avoid the 'too many file descriptors' error on big production servers
* Require a proper (>= 2.9.4) version of FUSE in order to avoid "fuse internal error: node XXXXXX not found"

This repository will be discounted as soon as I'll receive a response from maintainer.

```

## FUSE version concerns

It was reported that sometimes, mhddfs exits with the following error due to an internal bug in FUSE. It's highly suggested to use at least version 2.9.4 of FUSE in order to avoid that.

```nohighlight
fuse internal error: node 2238037 not found
```

## /etc/fstab rules
